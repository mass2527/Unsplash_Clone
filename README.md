# **Unsplash Clone** <img src="https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5b0c471ddb589cf22d4477a4/5cd716028463a5a1d1b1e73d_unsplash-app-icon-2.png" width="40">

This is a clone project of [**Unsplash**](https://unsplash.com) made with ReactJS and Typescript.

Unfortunately, as [**unsplash demo api**](https://unsplash.com/oauth/applications) restricts the number of requests per hour, i decided not to deploy demo of this clone.

### **What did i learn**

`1. learned importance of organized folder structure, clear variable name.`

As the size of app grows, rewriting code is imperative since i need to fix my code whenever i found a bug.  
 In this kind of moment, organized folder structure and clear variable name make me easily find the file.

`2. learned importance of code refactoring.`

Found out my brain works better when i am watcing clean code.  
 However, when i was trying to write some code on messy code, my brain was fried and don't want to think anymore.  
 Since then, i did code refactoring as much as i can.

`3. learned importance of DB structure.`

As i need to store lots of data like message, user and post, it was really important to have well organized DB strutures so that i can easily read, update or delete it.
